# Chromosome fusion hybrids

Collaboration project with the [Boeke lab](https://med.nyu.edu/research/boeke-lab/boeke-lab) on S288C-SK1 hybrid yeast strains with chromosome fusions. The resulting paper, ___Synthetic chromosome fusion: effects on genome structure and function___, is currently under preparation.

The raw sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number [GSE114731](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE114731) (private until publication).

The R code used to produce the figures can be found in this directory. Details about lower level data analysis, starting from the raw FASTQ files output by the illumina sequencer, can be found in the [data](data/README.md) section.
